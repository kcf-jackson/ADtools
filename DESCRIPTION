Title: Auto-Differentiation toolbox
Version: 0.2.6.0000
Author: Chun Fung Kwok
Maintainer: Chun Fung Kwok <kwokcf@unimelb.edu.au>
Description: Implements the forward-mode auto-differentiation for multivariate
    functions using the matrix-calculus notation from Magnus and Neudecker (1988).
    Two key features of the package are: (i) the package incorporates various 
    optimisaton strategies to improve performance; this includes applying 
    memoisation to cut down object construction time, using sparse matrix 
    representation to save derivative calculation, and creating specialised 
    matrix operations with Rcpp to reduce computation time; (ii) the package 
    supports differentiating random variable with respect to their parameters,
    which is developed targetting simulation-based (in particular MCMC) applications.
